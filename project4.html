      <h1 align=center> ENGINEERING </h1> <br>
      <p> <b>Engineering</b> is the creative application of science, mathematical methods, and empirical evidence to the innovation, design, construction, operation and maintenance of structures, machines, materials, devices, systems, processes, and organizations. </p>
      <p> The term engineering is derived from the Latin <i>ingenium</i>, meaning <strong>"cleverness"</strong> and <i>ingeniare</i>, meaning <b>"to contrive, devise"</b>.</p>

        <p>Civil engineering is the design and construction of public and private works, such as <ul> <li> infrastructure (airports, roads, railways, water supply, and treatment etc.)</li> <li> bridges</li> <li>tunnels</li>  <li>dams</li> <li> buildings</li> </ul> <br> Civil engineering is traditionally broken into a number of sub-disciplines, including structural engineering, environmental engineering, and surveying. It is traditionally considered to be separate from military engineering</p>

        <header> Computer Engineering </header>
        <p> Another industry that continues to expand is of course the Information Technology (IT) industry. This involves both computer sciences and electrical engineering. Successful graduates may find themselves in Telecommunications, Networking, Software Application Development, or Manufacturing, and additional industries are emerging, such as Application Development, Web Development, Network Security / Cybersecurity, and Cloud Computing, among others. This type of degree has good future potential as most industries rely on information technology. </p>

  <section class="main-section" id="Biomedical_Engineering">
    <header> Biomedical Engineering </header>
    <p> Biomedical engineering combines the study of medicine and biology. Biomedical Engineers apply their design skills to biological and medical sciences. They do this to assist in advancements in healthcare treatment technology. They develop and maintain diagnostic devices. Devices that include EEGs, MRIs, and other imaging machines. Physicians use these machines to diagnosis their patients’ medical problems. This is a fast moving industry and while challenging can be a rewarding career path to take. </p>

    <header> Other Branches </header>
    <p> Beyond these branches, a number of other branches are recognized, though many can be thought of as sub-disciplines of the four major branches, or as cross-curricular disciplines among multiple. </p> <p>Historically, naval engineering and mining engineering were major branches. Other engineering fields are manufacturing engineering, acoustical engineering, corrosion engineering, instrumentation and control, aerospace, automotive, computer, electronic, petroleum, environmental, systems, audio, software, architectural, agricultural, biosystems, biomedical, geological, textile, industrial, materials, and nuclear engineering. These and other branches of engineering are represented in the 36 licensed member institutions of the UK Engineering Council.</p>

<p>New specialties sometimes combine with the traditional fields and form new branches – for example, Earth systems engineering and management involves a wide range of subject areas including engineering studies, environmental science, engineering ethics and philosophy of engineering.

           <p>The earliest civil engineer known by name is <var> Imhotep</var>. As one of the officials of the Pharaoh, Djosèr, he probably designed and supervised the construction of the Pyramid of Djoser (the Step Pyramid) at Saqqara in Egypt around 2630–2611 BC. Ancient Greece developed machines in both civilian and military domains. The Antikythera mechanism, the first known mechanical computer, and the mechanical inventions of Archimedes are examples of early mechanical engineering. Some of Archimedes' inventions as well as the <samp>Antikythera mechanism</samp> required sophisticated knowledge of differential gearing or epicyclic gearing, two key principles in machine theory that helped design the gear trains of the Industrial Revolution, and are still widely used today in diverse fields such as robotics and automotive engineering.</p>

<p>Ancient Chinese, Greek, Roman and Hungarian armies employed military machines and inventions such as artillery which was developed by the Greeks around the 4th century B.C.the trireme, the ballista and the catapult. In the Middle Ages, the trebuchet was developed. </p>
